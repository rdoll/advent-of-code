<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>You're sure that's the right password, but the door won't open. You knock, but nobody answers. You build a snowman while you think.</p>
<p>As you're rolling the snowballs for your snowman, you find another security document that must have fallen into the snow:</p>
<p>"Due to newer security protocols, please use <em>password method <span title="You should have seen the chaos when the Elves overflowed their 32-bit password method counter.">0x434C49434B</span></em> until further notice."</p>
<p>You remember from the training seminar that "method 0x434C49434B" means you're actually supposed to count the number of times <em>any click</em> causes the dial to point at <code>0</code>, regardless of whether it happens during a rotation or at the end of one.</p>
<p>Following the same rotations as in the above example, the dial points at zero a few extra times during its rotations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dial starts by pointing at <code>50</code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L68</code> to point at <code>82</code>; during this rotation, it points at <code>0</code> <em>once</em>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L30</code> to point at <code>52</code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>R48</code> to point at <code><em>0</em></code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L5</code> to point at <code>95</code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>R60</code> to point at <code>55</code>; during this rotation, it points at <code>0</code> <em>once</em>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L55</code> to point at <code><em>0</em></code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L1</code> to point at <code>99</code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L99</code> to point at <code><em>0</em></code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>R14</code> to point at <code>14</code>.</li>
<li>The dial is rotated <code>L82</code> to point at <code>32</code>; during this rotation, it points at <code>0</code> <em>once</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this example, the dial points at <code>0</code> three times at the end of a rotation, plus three more times during a rotation. So, in this example, the new password would be <code><em>6</em></code>.</p>
<p>Be careful: if the dial were pointing at <code>50</code>, a single rotation like <code>R1000</code> would cause the dial to point at <code>0</code> ten times before returning back to <code>50</code>!</p>
<p>Using password method 0x434C49434B, <em>what is the password to open the door?</em></p>

### My Solution

* My input was [input.txt](input.txt)
* I wrote [part2.py](part2.py)
* My [part2-output.txt](part2-output.txt) was correct
