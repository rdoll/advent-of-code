<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>Thanks in part to your analysis, the Elves have figured out a little bit about the issue. They now know that the problematic data path passes through both <code>dac</code> (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital-to-analog_converter" target="_blank">digital-to-analog converter</a>) and <code>fft</code> (a device which performs a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform" target="_blank">fast Fourier transform</a>).</p>
<p>They're still not sure which specific path is the problem, and so they now need you to find every path from <code>svr</code> (the server rack) to <code>out</code>. However, the paths you find must all also visit both <code>dac</code> <em>and</em> <code>fft</code> (in any order).</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>svr: aaa bbb
aaa: fft
fft: ccc
bbb: tty
tty: ccc
ccc: ddd eee
ddd: hub
hub: fff
eee: dac
dac: fff
fff: ggg hhh
ggg: out
hhh: out
</code></pre>
<p>This new list of devices contains many paths from <code>svr</code> to <code>out</code>:</p>
<pre><code>svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out
svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out
svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,ggg,out
svr,aaa,<em>fft</em>,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,hhh,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,ggg,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,ddd,hub,fff,hhh,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,ggg,out
svr,bbb,tty,ccc,eee,<em>dac</em>,fff,hhh,out
</code></pre>
<p>However, only <em><code>2</code></em> paths from <code>svr</code> to <code>out</code> visit both <code>dac</code> and <code>fft</code>.</p>
<p>Find all of the paths that lead from <code>svr</code> to <code>out</code>. <em>How many of those paths visit both <code>dac</code> and <code>fft</code>?</em></p>

### My Solution

* My input was [input.txt](input.txt)
* I wrote [part2.py](part2.py)
* My [part2-output.txt](part2-output.txt) was correct
