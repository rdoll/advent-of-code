<article class="day-desc"><h2 id="part2">--- Part Two ---</h2><p>All of the machines are starting to come online! Now, it's time to worry about the joltage requirements.</p>
<p>Each machine needs to be configured to <em>exactly the specified joltage levels</em> to function properly. Below the buttons on each machine is a big lever that you can use to switch the buttons from configuring the indicator lights to increasing the joltage levels. (Ignore the indicator light diagrams.)</p>
<p>The machines each have a set of <em>numeric counters</em> tracking its joltage levels, one counter per joltage requirement. The counters are all <em>initially set to zero</em>.</p>
<p>So, joltage requirements like <code>{3,5,4,7}</code> mean that the machine has four counters which are initially <code>0</code> and that the goal is to simultaneously configure the first counter to be <code>3</code>, the second counter to be <code>5</code>, the third to be <code>4</code>, and the fourth to be <code>7</code>.</p>
<p>The button wiring schematics are still relevant: in this new joltage configuration mode, each button now indicates which counters it affects, where <code>0</code> means the first counter, <code>1</code> means the second counter, and so on. When you push a button, each listed counter is <em>increased by <code>1</code></em>.</p>
<p>So, a button wiring schematic like <code>(1,3)</code> means that each time you push that button, the second and fourth counters would each increase by <code>1</code>. If the current joltage levels were <code>{0,1,2,3}</code>, pushing the button would change them to be <code>{0,2,2,4}</code>.</p>
<p>You can push each button as many times as you like. However, your finger is getting sore from all the button pushing, and so you will need to determine the <em>fewest total presses</em> required to correctly configure each machine's joltage level counters to match the specified joltage requirements.</p>
<p>Consider again the example from before:</p>
<pre><code>[.##.] (3) (1,3) (2) (2,3) (0,2) (0,1) {3,5,4,7}
[...#.] (0,2,3,4) (2,3) (0,4) (0,1,2) (1,2,3,4) {7,5,12,7,2}
[.###.#] (0,1,2,3,4) (0,3,4) (0,1,2,4,5) (1,2) {10,11,11,5,10,5}
</code></pre>
<p>Configuring the first machine's counters requires a minimum of <code><em>10</em></code> button presses. One way to do this is by pressing <code>(3)</code> once, <code>(1,3)</code> three times, <code>(2,3)</code> three times, <code>(0,2)</code> once, and <code>(0,1)</code> twice.</p>
<p>Configuring the second machine's counters requires a minimum of <code><em>12</em></code> button presses. One way to do this is by pressing <code>(0,2,3,4)</code> twice, <code>(2,3)</code> five times, and <code>(0,1,2)</code> five times.</p>
<p>Configuring the third machine's counters requires a minimum of <code><em>11</em></code> button presses. One way to do this is by pressing <code>(0,1,2,3,4)</code> five times, <code>(0,1,2,4,5)</code> five times, and <code>(1,2)</code> once.</p>
<p>So, the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the joltage level counters on all of the machines is <code>10</code> + <code>12</code> + <code>11</code> = <code><em>33</em></code>.</p>
<p>Analyze each machine's joltage requirements and button wiring schematics. <em>What is the fewest button presses required to correctly configure the joltage level counters on all of the machines?</em></p>

### My Solution

* My input was [input.txt](input.txt)
* I wrote [part2.py](part2.py)
* My [part2-output.txt](part2-output.txt) was correct
